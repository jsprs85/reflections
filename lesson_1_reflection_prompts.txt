How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    reducing the code to the lines that had changed made it quicker to check for errors and make comparisons between the two files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    easier to revert to working copies, to correct inadvertent changes 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    autosaving would create commits where changes may not have been completed, where the code may not compile and may create too many commits. manually choosing commits allows them to be placed where changes have been completed

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
